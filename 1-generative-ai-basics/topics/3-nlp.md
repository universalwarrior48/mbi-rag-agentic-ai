# Natural Language Processing

## Understanding NLP
- NLP enables computers to comprehend human language, translating unstructured text (like spoken or written language) into structured data that machines can process.
- The process involves two main components: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for converting unstructured to structured data, and Natural Language Generation (NLG) for the reverse.

## Use Cases of NLP
- Machine Translation: NLP helps in accurately translating languages by understanding context, avoiding misinterpretations.
- Virtual Assistants and Chatbots: These applications utilize NLP to interpret user commands and provide appropriate responses.
- Sentiment Analysis: NLP can analyze text to determine the sentiment expressed, such as positive or negative feelings.
- Spam Detection: NLP identifies spam emails by analyzing content for specific indicators.

## NLP Techniques
- Tokenization: Breaking down text into manageable chunks (tokens).
- Stemming and Lemmatization: Techniques to reduce words to their base forms, with lemmatization being more context-aware.
- Part of Speech Tagging: Identifying the grammatical role of words in a sentence.
- Named Entity Recognition: Identifying entities (like names or locations) within the text.
