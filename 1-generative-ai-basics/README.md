# Develop Generative AI Applications: Get Started

This module introduces the core concepts of generative AI and walks you through the tools, frameworks, and models most commonly used in modern AI development. You’ll learn the fundamentals of prompt engineering—how carefully designed inputs can significantly improve the quality and reliability of AI outputs.

The module places a strong focus on the LangChain framework, explaining what it offers, why it’s useful, and how it fits into building real-world AI applications. You’ll also explore practical techniques such as creating reusable prompt templates for consistency, using in-context learning to guide model behavior, and refining prompts iteratively to get better, more accurate responses.

- Describe common tools and frameworks in AI development
